# Kaki project Johann & Jannis

This repo hosts the code of our projects for the HPI digital health seminar
"Applied Data Science on Real-word Hospital Data II" (*Kaki*).

## Structure

The repo is split into two parts since we had to cancel our original project "*
**l**ength **o**f **s**tay*" found in [`los/`](los/) and start over for our
final project "* **e**ffect **o**f **m**asks and other physical interventions*"
found in [`eom/`](eom/).

## Setup

Run `pre-commit install` from root of the repository to ensure that Jupyter
Notebook outputs are cleared before committing
